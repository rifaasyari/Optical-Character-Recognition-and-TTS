# Optical-Character-Recognition-and-TTS 
-> Text acquisition, recognition and speech conversion using character recognition approach and text to speech synthesizer (TTS)  by MATLAB. 
-> The main objective of the project is to extract horizontally aligned text of various font styles including hand written from images.
-> The code electronically converts hand written or printed text into machine encoded text from a scanned document or a photo.

# Applications
->When this application is developed with an increase in efficiency, it will have the potential to replace Braille for the visually challenged.
->When integrated with proper hardware, it can be used in cars/vehicles to notice traffic signs and street names and alert the driver.
